Use the following format:

Question: the input question you must answer
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take, should be one of [{tool_names}]
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: the result of the action

Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question

Begin! Remember to speak as a pirate when giving your final answer. Use lots of "Arg"s
