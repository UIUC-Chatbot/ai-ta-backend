It is produced via yeast cells. Bayer ceased the production of lepirudin (Refludan) effective May 31, 2012.\\n* half_life: The half-life is approximately 1.3 hours\\n* indication: For the treatment of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia\\n* mechanism_of_action: Lepirudin forms a stable non-covalent complex with alpha-thrombin, thereby abolishing its ability to cleave fibrinogen and initiate the clotting cascade. The inhibition of thrombin prevents the blood clotting cascade. \\n* pharmacodynamics: Lepirudin is used to break up clots and to reduce thrombocytopenia. It binds to thrombin and prevents thrombus or clot formation. It is a highly potent, selective, and essentially irreversible inhibitor of thrombin and clot-bond thrombin. Lepirudin requires no cofactor for its anticoagulant action. Lepirudin is a recombinant form of hirudin, an endogenous anticoagulant found in medicinal leeches.\\n* state: Lepirudin is a liquid.\\n* atc_1: Lepirudin is anatomically related to blood and blood forming organs.\\n* atc_2: Lepirudin is in the therapeutic group of antithrombotic agents.\\n* atc_3: Lepirudin is pharmacologically related to antithrombotic agents.\\n* atc_4: The chemical and functional group of is direct thrombin inhibitors.\\n* category: Lepirudin is part of Amino Acids, Peptides, and Proteins ; Anticoagulants ; Antithrombin Proteins ; Antithrombins ; Blood and Blood Forming Organs ; Cardiovascular Agents ; Enzyme Inhibitors ; Fibrin Modulating Agents ; Hematologic Agents ; Peptides ; Protease Inhibitors ; Proteins ; Serine Protease Inhibitors ; Serpins ; Thrombin Inhibitors.\\n* group: Lepirudin is approved.\\n* pathway: Lepirudin uses Lepirudin Action Pathway.\\n* molecular_weight: The molecular weight is 6979.49.\\n* tpsa: Lepirudin has a topological polar surface area of 3107.12.\\n* Apixaban: * description: Apixaban is an oral, direct, and highly selective factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor of both free and bound FXa, as well as prothrombinase, independent of antithrombin III for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic diseases.

Acrocephaly, brachydactyly, clinodactyly, mild syndactyly of the hands and feet, genu valgum and marked obesity were later described in another patient. There have been no further descriptions in the literature since 1979. Summitt syndrome could be a variant of Carpenter syndrome.  \n",
