      "using smartphone-based acoustic artificial intelligence software. Differences in cough frequency were\n",

      "monitoring.\n",
      "Results 616 participants were monitored for an aggregated duration of over 9 person-years and registered\n",
      "62 325 coughs. This empiric analysis found that an individual’s cough patterns are stochastic, following a\n",
      "binomial distribution. When compared to continuous monitoring, limiting observation to 24 h can lead\n",
      "to inaccurate estimates of change in cough frequency, particularly in persons with low or small changes\n",

      "Cough is common in patients with respiratory diseases, and relatively rare in healthy individuals [1].\n",
      "Detecting changes in its frequency is important in managing patients with cough and for evaluating novel\n",
      "drugs [2, 3]. An optimal objective cough monitoring period has not yet been defined [4–7], but in most\n",
      "clinical research settings, it remains limited to 24-h periods [8, 9].\n",
      "While 24-h monitoring is the most commonly used approach in clinical research [9, 10], this strategy’s\n",
      "ability to capture longer trends or discontinuous changes remains unclear. Estimates of shorter cough\n",
      "frequency can be confounded by circadian changes [11, 12].\n",

      "Recent progress in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) has enabled the development of tools to\n",
      "unobtrusively monitor cough over protracted periods of time. This includes smartphone-based applications\n",
      "that employ acoustic AI to detect and track cough. We recently reported the use of one such tool to\n",
      "monitor cough among the inhabitants of Pamplona, Spain [13]. We now present a statistical analysis of the\n",
      "data collected in that cohort and explore its implications for patient care and drug development.\n",
      "In this study we aim to determine the impact that the duration of cough monitoring has in the capacity to\n",
      "detect changes in its frequency, and hypothesise that, given the stochastic nature of cough, protracted\n",
      "longitudinal monitoring could provide more representative estimates of its frequency.\n",
      "Methods\n",
      "Study subjects\n",
      "The data used for this analysis is from participants in a cohort study conducted in the city of Pamplona\n",
      "(northern Spain), as well as the University of Navarra’s students and staff between fall 2020 and fall 2021.\n",
      "The aim of the study was to assess the potential correlation between the local incidence of respiratory\n",
      "diseases and the coughs in the cohort captured using a smartphone-based system. We targeted participants\n",
      "with and without respiratory diseases. Recruitment strategies included a broad information campaign\n",
      "carried out via social networks and through face-to-face meetings, with support from university and\n",
      "municipal authorities. A full protocol describing inclusion criteria has been published [14]. All participants\n",
      "signed informed consent, and this project was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee for\n",
      "Medical Research of the Chartered Community of Navarra (PI2020/107) and the Comité d’éthique à la\n",
      "recherche du Centre Hospitalier de l’Université de Montréal (2021-9247). The main study was registered in\n",
      "www.clinicaltrials.gov, under the number NCT04762693, and its results have been submitted separately\n",
      "for publication.\n",
      "Study design\n",
      "The overarching objective of this analysis was to assess the impact of the duration of cough monitoring on\n",
      "the capacity to detect changes in its frequency. Specific objectives include: 1) describing the distribution\n",
      "and circadian pattern of cough frequency in the studied cohort; 2) evaluating the role of effect size on the\n",
      "capacity to detect such changes; and 3) determining an optimal monitoring period and 4) comparing the\n",
      "capacity of estimates based on 24-h monitoring to longitudinal records to detect changes in cough\n",
      "frequency.\n",
      "This is an empiric statistical analysis of a larger cohort acoustic surveillance study. Sample size\n",
      "calculations and the study’s main results have been described elsewhere [13, 14].\n",
      "Monitoring\n",
      "Cough frequency was monitored using Hyfe Cough Tracker (Wilmington, DE, USA, https://www.hyfeapp.\n",
      "com/, henceforth referred to as Hyfe). Hyfe uses a device and cloud-based neural networks (CNN) to\n",
      "identify cough while preserving privacy. The CNN assigns a cough prediction score to each sound; if such\n",
      "a score lies above a predetermined value (in this study, 0.70 out of 1.0), the sound is labelled as a cough.\n",
      "The analytical performance of the algorithm was evaluated in a pilot sub-study that reported a sensitivity\n",
      "of 96.34% and a specificity of 96.54% among detected sounds [14], and is better characterised in a nested\n",
      "study of solicited sounds from 49 participants submitted jointly with this article. Additional clinical\n",
      "validation in specific diseases is underway (NCT05042063). All participants were instructed to install Hyfe\n",
      "in their personal mobile phones and use it for at least 6 h a day, during the night-time. Those willing to\n",
      "use it continuously or for longer periods were encouraged to do so.\n",
      "Analysis\n",
      "Participants with <1 h of recording data were excluded from all further analysis. To compare the capacity\n",
      "of 24-h monitoring with longitudinal records to detect changes in cough frequency, a randomisation\n",
      "routine was used to simulate the data that would have been obtained by monitoring two participants for a\n",
      "24-h period. These two participants were selected for having used the monitoring system regularly\n",
      "throughout the study and because they received interventions that clearly modified their cough frequency.\n",
